# minimal-productivity-apps


I needed a tool for my work to manage tasks and write down some notes, but must of the tools out there are either complicated or lacking a nice and solid UI. So I decided to make one that suits my needs. It is minimal and includs Tasks Tracker, Timer and Notes manager.
